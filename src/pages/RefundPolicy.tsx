            <p>
              Thank you for ordering with <strong>BiteOS Tech</strong>. Since we deal in perishable food items prepared on-demand, strictly the following refund and cancellation policies apply:
            </p>

            <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-4">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-foreground">Cancellation Policy:</strong> 
                <p>
                  You can cancel your order ONLY if the status is <strong>"Pending"</strong> (i.e., the canteen has not yet accepted or started preparing your food). 
                  <br/>
                  Once the order status changes to <strong>"Preparing"</strong> or <strong>"Ready"</strong>, the order cannot be cancelled as ingredients have already been used.
                </p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                <strong className="text-foreground">Refunds for Cancelled Orders:</strong> 
                <p>
                  If you successfully cancel an order while it is still in the "Pending" stage, 100% of the amount will be refunded to your original payment source.
                </p>
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong className="text-foreground">Failed Transactions:</strong> 
                <p>
                  If money was deducted from your bank account but the order was not generated due to a technical error (network failure, server issue), the amount will be automatically refunded to your source account.
                </p>
              </li>
              
              <li>
                <strong className="text-foreground">Refund Timeline:</strong> 
                <p>
                   All refunds (for cancellations or failed transactions) will be processed and credited to your original method of payment (UPI/Bank Account) within <strong>5-7 working days</strong>.
                </p>
              </li>

                <strong className="text-foreground">Returns & Replacements:</strong> 
                <p>
                  Since food is a perishable good, <strong>we do not accept returns</strong> once the food has been handed over to you.
                  <br/>
                  If you find the food to be stale, foreign objects are found, or the wrong item was served, please report it to the canteen counter immediately (within 15 minutes of pickup) for a replacement or resolution.
                </p>
              </li>
